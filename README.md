## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you're looking for me professionally, see [my LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/bhart).

For personal stuff, see:
- [bbhart.com](https://www.bbhart.com) (a Jekyll site served by GitHub Pages) where I mostly write about travel and tech.
- [me on threads](https://www.threads.net/@bbhart_insta)
- [Random things on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@BrianHart), again mostly travels, tech, and video games. Keep an eye
  out for the occassional 360 video on there, too.
- [Videos on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/bbhart), likely some duplication with YouTube but I tend to post more videos here
